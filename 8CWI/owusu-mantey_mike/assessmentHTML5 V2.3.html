<h1>FAVOURITE</h1>
<p>
My favourite players are: Kyrie Irving as well as Kd (Kevin Durant).
Not only those players as I am quite fond with Russell westbrook who is helping out the Oklahoma team as he is part of what once was, the Oklahoma dream team
Which consisted of players like: KD, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Seirge Ibaka Perkins and many more.

But unfortunately Russell Westbrook is the only member of that dream team present to this day that still plays for Oklahoma.
<p>
Last but not least another one of my favourite players is Jimmy Butler.
In my eyes he has one of the best side steps and step backs within the NBA.
As well as Kyrie Irving of course.
