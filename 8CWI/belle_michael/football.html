<h1>Football</h1>
<p>
Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball.
 It is played by 250 million players in and over 200 countries , making it the world's most popular sport.
 The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.

The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and only in their penalty area.
 Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use their head or torso.
 The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition.
